# Line_Following_Robot
A Line Following Robot is an autonomous robot that detects and follows a visual line  embedded on the surface. Most commonly, the line is black on a white surface. The robot uses IR (infrared) sensors to detect the line and sends signals to the Arduino, which  processes the input and adjusts the direction of the robot using motor controls.
